# ðŸš¨ URGENT: Booking Flow Fix Action Plan

## CRITICAL ISSUE DIAGNOSIS

### ðŸ”´ PRIMARY PROBLEM: Code Not Deployed
Our diagnostic script revealed:
- **10 pending bookings with EMPTY metadata** `{}` 
- Our code should store `initial_sms` in metadata, but it's not happening
- **ZERO SMS messages recorded** in the last 24 hours
- **customer_id constraint still NOT NULL** in messages table

### ðŸŽ¯ ROOT CAUSE
The code changes we pushed to GitHub are NOT running in production.

## IMMEDIATE ACTION STEPS

### Step 1: Verify Deployment Status (DO THIS FIRST)
1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard**: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. **Check recent deployments** for your project
3. **Look for**:
   - Last deployment time (should be after our commit 3aee739)
   - Deployment status (should be "Ready")
   - Any failed deployments or errors

### Step 2: If Code Is Not Deployed

#### Option A: Manual Deployment
```bash
# If you have Vercel CLI installed
vercel --prod

# Or trigger from Vercel dashboard
# Go to project > Deployments > Redeploy
```

#### Option B: Check GitHub Integration
1. Go to Vercel project settings
2. Check Git Integration settings
3. Verify:
   - Connected to correct repository
   - Deploying from `main` branch
   - GitHub webhooks are enabled

#### Option C: Force Deployment
1. Make a trivial change (add a comment)
2. Push to GitHub
3. Monitor Vercel dashboard for deployment

### Step 3: Alternative IMMEDIATE Fix (If Deployment Fails)

Since SMS is critical for business operations, here's a temporary workaround:

#### Create an Emergency Migration
```sql
-- TEMPORARY FIX: Make customer_id nullable in messages table
-- Run this directly in Supabase SQL Editor if deployment is blocked

ALTER TABLE messages ALTER COLUMN customer_id DROP NOT NULL;

-- This allows SMS to be recorded even without customer_id
-- We can clean up later when the proper fix is deployed
```

### Step 4: Verify Fix Is Working

Run this test after deployment or migration:
```bash
# Test the API endpoint
curl -X POST https://management.orangejelly.co.uk/api/bookings/initiate \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "event_id": "YOUR_EVENT_ID",
    "mobile_number": "07700900123"
  }'
```

Then check:
1. SMS was sent
2. pending_bookings has metadata.initial_sms
3. No errors in response

### Step 5: Monitor Results

After fix is applied:
```bash
# Run diagnosis again
tsx scripts/diagnose-booking-issues.ts
```

Look for:
- âœ… Pending bookings WITH metadata
- âœ… SMS messages being recorded
- âœ… No null customer_id errors

## ðŸ”¥ ESCALATION PATH

If deployment continues to fail:

1. **Check Vercel Build Logs**
   - Look for build errors
   - Check environment variables are set
   - Verify build command is correct

2. **GitHub Repository Issues**
   - Ensure GitHub Actions aren't blocking
   - Check branch protection rules
   - Verify push permissions

3. **Emergency Contact**
   - Contact Vercel support if deployment is stuck
   - Consider using Vercel CLI for direct deployment

## ðŸ“Š Success Criteria

You'll know the fix is working when:
1. API returns 201 with `sms_sent: true`
2. No "null customer_id" errors in logs
3. Customers receive SMS confirmations
4. pending_bookings contain metadata with initial_sms

## ðŸŽ¯ Long-term Solution

Once immediate issue is resolved:
1. Set up deployment notifications
2. Add monitoring for critical flows
3. Create automated tests for booking flow
4. Document deployment process
