# üö® URGENT: Table Booking API Fix Needs Deployment

## Current Status
- **Fix Committed**: ‚úÖ YES (commit: d88bed9)
- **Pushed to GitHub**: ‚úÖ YES
- **Deployed to Production**: ‚ùå NOT YET

## The Problem
The website developer is getting `DATABASE_ERROR` because the API is trying to insert an `email` field that doesn't exist in the `customers` table.

## The Fix
I've fixed the API code to:
1. Remove the email field before inserting customer data
2. Add proper error logging
3. Handle optional fields correctly

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Wait for Auto-Deploy (Recommended)
Vercel should automatically deploy from GitHub. Check the Vercel dashboard to see if deployment is in progress.

### Option 2: Manual Deploy via Vercel
1. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com)
2. Find the `anchor-management-tools` project
3. Click "Redeploy" on the latest commit

### Option 3: Force Deploy via CLI
```bash
vercel --prod
```

## How to Verify Deployment
Once deployed, run:
```bash
tsx scripts/check-deployment-status.ts
```

If it shows "‚úÖ FIX IS DEPLOYED!" then the website will work.

## For the Website Developer
Please inform them that:
1. Their implementation is CORRECT
2. The bug is on our server side
3. We've fixed it but need to deploy
4. Once deployed (should be within 10-15 minutes), their API calls will work

## Test the Fix Locally
If you want to verify the fix works before deployment:
```bash
npm run dev
# Then in another terminal:
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/table-bookings \
  -H "X-API-Key: anch_iPRE-XAgeN-D5QcfNTy_DxDbi1kZcrWg110ZroLotY4" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "booking_type": "regular",
    "date": "2025-07-28",
    "time": "19:00",
    "party_size": 2,
    "customer": {
      "first_name": "Test",
      "last_name": "User",
      "mobile_number": "07700900123",
      "sms_opt_in": true
    }
  }'
```

## Summary
The code fix is complete and pushed to GitHub. We're just waiting for it to be deployed to production. The website developer's table booking functionality will work as soon as the deployment completes.
