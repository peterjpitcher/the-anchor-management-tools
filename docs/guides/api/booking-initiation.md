# Booking Initiation API Documentation

## Overview

The Booking Initiation API allows external websites to initiate bookings for events at The Anchor. This API implements a two-step confirmation process:

1. **Initiate Booking**: Submit a mobile number and event ID to start the booking process
2. **Confirm Booking**: Customer receives an SMS with a shortened link to confirm their booking and specify the number of seats

## Authentication

All API requests require authentication using an API key. Include the API key in the `Authorization` header:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

API keys can be generated in the management system at `/settings/api-keys`. Ensure your API key has the `write:bookings` permission.

### 2. SMS Flow

When a booking is initiated:

1. **Existing Customer**: Receives a personalized SMS:
   ```
   Hi John, please confirm your booking for Friday Night Jazz on 05/01/2024 at 19:30. Click here to confirm: https://vip-club.uk/abc123
   ```

2. **New Customer**: Receives a welcome SMS:
   ```
   Welcome to The Anchor! Please confirm your booking for Friday Night Jazz on 05/01/2024 at 19:30. Click here to confirm: https://vip-club.uk/abc123
   ```

### 3. Confirmation Page

When customers click the shortened link, they are redirected to a confirmation page where they:

1. **New Customers**: Enter their first and last name
2. **All Customers**: Select the number of seats (1-10)
3. Click "Confirm Booking" to complete the process

After confirmation:
- The booking is created in the system
- A confirmation SMS is sent with booking details
- The customer is redirected to a success page showing their confirmation number

### 4. Booking Confirmation (Internal)

The confirmation process is handled internally via the web interface. The API does not expose a direct confirmation endpoint.

## Error Handling

All error responses follow this format:

```json
{
  "error": "Human-readable error message",
  "code": "ERROR_CODE",
  "details": {}  // Optional additional information
}
```

**Common Error Codes:**
- `VALIDATION_ERROR`: Invalid input data
- `NOT_FOUND`: Resource not found
- `EVENT_NOT_AVAILABLE`: Event is cancelled or not scheduled
- `EVENT_FULL`: No available capacity
- `INSUFFICIENT_CAPACITY`: Not enough seats for requested amount
- `SMS_OPT_OUT`: Customer has opted out of SMS
- `DATABASE_ERROR`: Database operation failed
- `SYSTEM_ERROR`: Internal server error

## Rate Limiting

- API requests are rate-limited to 100 requests per minute per API key
- SMS sending is rate-limited to prevent abuse
- Exceeded limits return `429 Too Many Requests`

## Integration Example

### JavaScript/Fetch
```javascript
const initiateBooking = async (eventId, mobileNumber) => {
  const response = await fetch('https://management.orangejelly.co.uk/api/bookings/initiate', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY',
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      event_id: eventId,
      mobile_number: mobileNumber,
    }),
  });

  if (!response.ok) {
    const error = await response.json();
    throw new Error(error.error);
  }

  return await response.json();
};

// Usage
try {
  const result = await initiateBooking('550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000', '07700900123');
  console.log('Booking initiated:', result.confirmation_url);
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Booking failed:', error.message);
}
```

### cURL
```bash
curl -X POST https://management.orangejelly.co.uk/api/bookings/initiate \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "event_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
    "mobile_number": "07700900123"
  }'
```

## Best Practices

1. **Phone Number Validation**: Validate UK phone numbers on your end before calling the API
2. **Event Availability**: Consider caching event availability to reduce API calls
3. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling for all possible error scenarios
4. **User Feedback**: Inform users that they'll receive an SMS to confirm their booking
5. **Expiry Handling**: Booking links expire after 24 hours - communicate this to users
6. **SMS Delivery**: SMS delivery is not guaranteed - provide alternative contact methods

## Testing

For testing purposes:
- Use the sandbox environment if available
- Test with valid UK mobile numbers only
- Ensure your API key has the correct permissions
- Test all error scenarios
