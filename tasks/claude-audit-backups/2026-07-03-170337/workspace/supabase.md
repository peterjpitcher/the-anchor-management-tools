# Supabase Conventions

## Client Patterns

Two Supabase client patterns — always use the correct one:

```typescript
// Server-side auth (anon key + cookie session) — use for auth checks:
const supabase = await getSupabaseServerClient();
const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser();

// Server-side data (service-role, bypasses RLS) — use for system/cron operations:
const db = await getDb(); // or createClient() with service role
const { data } = await db.from("table").select("*").eq("id", id).single();

// Browser-only (client components):
const supabase = getSupabaseBrowserClient();
```

ESLint rules should prevent importing the admin/service-role client in client components.

## snake_case ↔ camelCase Conversion

DB columns are always `snake_case`; TypeScript types are `camelCase` with Date objects. Always wrap DB results:

```typescript
import { fromDb } from "@/lib/utils";
const record = fromDb<MyType>(dbRow); // converts snake_case keys + ISO strings → Date
```

All type definitions should live in a central types file (e.g. `src/types/database.ts`).

## Row Level Security (RLS)

- RLS is always enabled on all tables
- Use the anon-key client for user-scoped operations (respects RLS)
- Use the service-role client only for system operations, crons, and webhooks
- Never disable RLS "temporarily" — create a proper service-role path instead

## Migrations

```bash
npx supabase db push          # Apply pending migrations
npx supabase migration new    # Create a new migration file
```

- Migrations live in `supabase/migrations/`
- Full schema reference in `supabase/schema.sql` (paste into SQL Editor for fresh setup)
- Never run destructive migrations (DROP COLUMN/TABLE) without explicit approval
- Test migrations locally with `npx supabase db push --dry-run` before pushing (see `verification-pipeline.md`)

### Dropping columns or tables — mandatory function audit

When a migration drops a column or table, you MUST search for every function and trigger that references it and update them in the same migration. Failing to do so leaves silent breakage: PL/pgSQL functions that reference a dropped column/table throw an exception at runtime, and if any of those functions have an `EXCEPTION WHEN OTHERS THEN` handler, the error is swallowed and returned as a generic blocked/failure state — making the bug invisible until someone notices the feature is broken.

**Before writing any `DROP COLUMN` or `DROP TABLE`:**

```sql
-- Find all functions that reference the column or table
SELECT routine_name, routine_definition
FROM information_schema.routines
WHERE routine_definition ILIKE '%column_or_table_name%'
  AND routine_type = 'FUNCTION';
```

Or search the migrations directory:
```bash
grep -r "column_or_table_name" supabase/migrations/ --include="*.sql" -l
```

For each function found: update it in the same migration to remove or replace the reference. Never leave a function referencing infrastructure that no longer exists.

This also applies to **triggers** — check trigger functions separately:
```bash
grep -r "column_or_table_name" supabase/migrations/ --include="*.sql" -n
```

## Auth

- Supabase Auth with JWT + HTTP-only cookies
- Auth checks happen in layout files or middleware
- Server actions must always re-verify auth server-side (never rely on UI hiding)
- Public routes must be explicitly allowlisted

## Audit Logging

All mutations (create, update, delete) in server actions must call `logAuditEvent()`:

```typescript
await logAuditEvent({
  user_id: user.id,
  operation_type: 'update',
  resource_type: 'thing',
  operation_status: 'success'
});
```
