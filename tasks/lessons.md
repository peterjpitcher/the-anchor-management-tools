## 2026-04-20: Always verify day-of-week before sending customer-facing messages

**Mistake:** Sent 32 SMS saying "Music Bingo is this Thursday" when April 24 2026 is a Friday. Required a correction message to all recipients.

**Rule:** When composing any customer-facing message that references a day of the week, ALWAYS compute and verify the day programmatically (e.g. `new Date('2026-04-24').toLocaleDateString('en-GB', { weekday: 'long' })`) before sending. Never assume or calculate mentally.
