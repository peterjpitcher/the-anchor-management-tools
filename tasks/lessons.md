## 2026-04-20: Always verify day-of-week before sending customer-facing messages

**Mistake:** Sent 32 SMS saying "Music Bingo is this Thursday" when April 24 2026 is a Friday. Required a correction message to all recipients.

**Rule:** When composing any customer-facing message that references a day of the week, ALWAYS compute and verify the day programmatically (e.g. `new Date('2026-04-24').toLocaleDateString('en-GB', { weekday: 'long' })`) before sending. Never assume or calculate mentally.

## 2026-05-28: Serialize operational errors explicitly

**Mistake:** Logged provider/client error objects directly, which hid important diagnostic fields in production logs.

**Rule:** Never `JSON.stringify(error)` directly. Always destructure `code`, `message`, `details`, and `hint` for Supabase errors, or the relevant enumerable fields for provider errors such as PayPal and Twilio.

## 2026-05-28: Keep audit-log writers aligned with schema

**Mistake:** Audit-log writers used legacy column names such as `entity_type`, `entity_id`, `operation_details`, and `metadata` against the canonical `audit_logs` table.

**Rule:** Before adding or renaming columns referenced by an audit-log writer, grep every `from('audit_logs').insert(` callsite and update all writers in the same migration/change.
