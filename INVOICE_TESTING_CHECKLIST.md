# üéâ Invoice System Testing Checklist

**Database Push Complete!** Now let's verify everything is working correctly.

## ‚úÖ Quick Verification (Do This First)

Run this SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor to confirm setup:

```sql
-- Quick health check
SELECT 
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM permissions WHERE module_name IN ('invoices', 'quotes')) as permissions_count,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM invoice_series WHERE series_code IN ('INV', 'QTE')) as series_count,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM roles r 
   JOIN role_permissions rp ON r.id = rp.role_id 
   JOIN permissions p ON rp.permission_id = p.id 
   WHERE p.module_name = 'invoices') as roles_with_access;
```

**Expected Results:**
- permissions_count: 15
- series_count: 2  
- roles_with_access: 3 or more

JOIN user_roles ur ON u.id = ur.user_id  
JOIN roles r ON ur.role_id = r.id
WHERE u.email = 'your-email@example.com';
```

### If invoice number isn't generating
```sql
-- Check series initialization
SELECT * FROM invoice_series;
-- If empty, run:
INSERT INTO invoice_series (series_code, current_sequence) 
VALUES ('INV', 0), ('QTE', 0);
```

### If PDF download fails
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify Puppeteer is installed: `npm ls puppeteer`
