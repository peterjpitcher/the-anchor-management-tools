## Analysis

### False Positives
Most of the "orphaned" pages are actually **not orphaned** - they are dynamic routes that are linked using template literals like:
- `href={\`/employees/\${employee.employee_id}\`}`
- `href={\`/events/\${event.id}\`}`
- `href={\`/customers/\${customer.id}\`}`

The script couldn't detect these because they use dynamic IDs that are resolved at runtime.

### Truly Orphaned Page
Only one page appears to be truly orphaned:
- **`/private-bookings/:id/items`** - This page exists but has no incoming links from any other pages in the application.

## Recommendations

1. **Remove or Link the Items Page**: The `/private-bookings/:id/items` page should either be:
   - Removed if it's no longer needed
   - Linked from the private booking detail page if it provides value

2. **Script Improvements**: The orphaned page detection script should be enhanced to:
   - Better handle dynamic routes with template literals
   - Parse JSX/TSX more accurately to find dynamic href patterns
   - Check for programmatic navigation (router.push, redirect, etc.)

3. **Navigation Verification**: All dynamic pages were verified to have proper incoming links from their respective list pages or parent detail pages, confirming the navigation structure is working as intended.
