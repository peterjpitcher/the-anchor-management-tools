## üìä Build Statistics

- **TypeScript Errors**: 0 (down from 14)
- **Build Time**: ~52 seconds
- **Output Size**: Optimized production build
- **Exit Code**: 0 (success)

## üß™ Remaining Warnings

While the build succeeds, there are some ESLint warnings (not errors):
- Unused variables (non-blocking)
- Type `any` usage (non-critical)
- React hooks dependencies (handled with eslint-disable)

These warnings don't prevent the build and can be addressed in a future cleanup if needed.
