# ✅ Invoice System Routes Fixed

## 🔍 Issue Found
The recurring invoice edit link (`/invoices/recurring/[id]/edit`) was causing a 404 error because the page files didn't exist.

## 🛠️ What Was Fixed

### 1. Created Missing Recurring Invoice Pages
- **Created**: `/src/app/(authenticated)/invoices/recurring/[id]/page.tsx` - View recurring invoice details
- **Created**: `/src/app/(authenticated)/invoices/recurring/[id]/edit/page.tsx` - Edit recurring invoice

### 2. Updated Navigation Flow
- Changed recurring invoice list to link to view page first (not directly to edit)
- From view page, users can click "Edit" button to modify

### 3. Added Desktop Navigation Link
- Fixed missing "Recurring" link in desktop navigation (was only on mobile)
