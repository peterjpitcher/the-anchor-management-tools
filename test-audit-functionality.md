# Audit Trail Implementation Testing Guide

## Current Status

The audit trail has been implemented with the following fixes:

1. **Fixed Column Names**: Updated to use the correct database column names:
   - `resource_type` instead of `entity_type`
   - `resource_id` instead of `entity_id`
   - `operation_type` instead of `action`
   - `additional_info` instead of `details`

2. **Updated Audit Logging**: All employee actions now properly log to the audit_logs table with:
   - Correct operation types (create, update, delete, etc.)
   - Resource type set to 'employee'
   - Resource ID set to the employee ID
   - Operation status (success/failure)
   - Additional info containing action-specific details

3. **Enhanced UI**: The audit trail component now:
   - Shows a timeline view of all changes
   - Color-codes actions (green for create, blue for update, red for delete)
   - Displays user email, timestamp, and details
   - Shows specific action descriptions based on the operation

## How to Test

1. **Navigate to an employee detail page**
2. **Click on the "Audit Trail" tab**
3. **Perform various actions** to generate audit logs:
   - Update employee details
   - Add a note
   - Upload an attachment
   - Update emergency contacts
   - Update financial details
   - Update health records
   - Update right to work information
   - Check items in the onboarding checklist

4. **Refresh the audit trail** to see new entries appear

## What Should Appear

Each audit log entry should show:
- The user who made the change
- The type of action performed
- When the action occurred
- Relevant details about what changed

## Troubleshooting

If no audit logs appear:

1. **Check the browser console** for errors
2. **Verify the audit_logs table exists** in your Supabase database
3. **Ensure your user has permission** to view employee records
4. **Check that actions are completing successfully** (only successful operations are logged)

## Database Query

To manually check audit logs in Supabase:

```sql
SELECT * FROM audit_logs 
WHERE resource_type = 'employee' 
AND resource_id = 'YOUR_EMPLOYEE_ID_HERE'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```
