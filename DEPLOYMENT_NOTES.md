# VIP-CLUB.UK Redirect Fix - Deployment Notes

## Issue Fixed
Short links on vip-club.uk domain were redirecting to the login page instead of their intended destinations.

## Root Cause
The authentication middleware was intercepting requests to vip-club.uk before Vercel's rewrites could route them to the redirect handler.

## Solution Applied
Updated `src/middleware.ts` to skip authentication checks for any request with hostname containing 'vip-club.uk'.

## How It Works
1. Request comes in to vip-club.uk/[code]
2. Middleware checks hostname and skips auth for vip-club.uk
3. Vercel rewrite rules route request to /api/redirect/[code]
4. Redirect handler looks up short link and redirects to destination
5. If link not found or deleted, redirects to the-anchor.pub

## Testing After Deployment
1. Clear browser cache and cookies
2. Open incognito/private window  
3. Visit https://vip-club.uk/gt341d
4. Should redirect to WhatsApp link WITHOUT login page

## Verification Commands
```bash
# Check existing short links
tsx scripts/test-short-link.ts gt341d

# Test CRUD operations
tsx scripts/test-short-link-crud.ts

# Verify redirect fix
tsx scripts/test-vip-club-redirect.ts
```

## Important Notes
- All vip-club.uk domains (including www) bypass authentication
- Deleted links redirect to https://www.the-anchor.pub
- Edit functionality allows changing destination URL, type, and expiration
- Short codes cannot be edited once created
