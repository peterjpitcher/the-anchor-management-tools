## Workflow Orchestration

### Plan Mode Default
Enter plan mode for any non-trivial task (3+ steps or architectural decisions). If something goes sideways, STOP and re-plan immediately — don't keep pushing. Use plan mode for verification steps, not just building. Write detailed specs upfront to reduce ambiguity.

### Subagent Strategy
Use subagents liberally to keep the main context window clean. Offload research, exploration, and parallel analysis to subagents. For complex problems, throw more compute at it via subagents. One task per subagent for focused execution. When exploring the codebase, use subagents to read multiple sections in parallel.

### Self-Improvement Loop
After ANY correction from the user, update `tasks/lessons.md` with the pattern. Write rules for yourself that prevent the same mistake. Review `tasks/lessons.md` at session start.

### Verification Before Done
Never mark a task complete without proving it works. Diff behaviour between main and your changes when relevant. Ask yourself: "Would a staff engineer approve this?" Run tests, check logs, demonstrate correctness.

### Demand Elegance (Balanced)
For non-trivial changes, pause and ask "is there a more elegant way?" Skip this for simple, obvious fixes — don't over-engineer. Challenge your own work before presenting it.

### Autonomous Bug Fixing
When given a bug report, just fix it. Don't ask for hand-holding. Check Supabase logs, Vercel deployment logs, and browser console. Point at errors, then resolve them. Zero context switching from the user.

## Task Management

1. **Plan First**: Write plan to `tasks/todo.md` with checkable items
2. **Verify Plan**: Check in before starting implementation
3. **Track Progress**: Mark items complete as you go
4. **Explain Changes**: High-level summary at each step
5. **Document Results**: Add review section to `tasks/todo.md`
6. **Capture Lessons**: Update `tasks/lessons.md` after corrections

---

## Core Principles

- **Simplicity First**: Make every change as simple as possible. Minimal code impact.
- **No Laziness**: Find root causes. No temporary fixes. Senior developer standards.
- **Minimal Impact**: Changes should only touch what's necessary. Avoid introducing bugs.
- **Test Against Reality**: Don't assume code is correct because it exists. Trace the actual logic.

---

## Domain Rules

- £10 deposit per person for groups of 7 or more (NOT credit card holds — that was old functionality)
- Events hosted by the venue itself are exceptions to deposit rules
- Contracts must be generated for private bookings
- Booking amendments, cancellations, and deletions must track payment state correctly
- All customer-facing language must reflect current policies, not legacy ones
- Legacy "credit card hold" language anywhere in code or templates is always a bug

---

## Prompting Conventions

- **Challenge as reviewer**: "Grill me on these changes and don't make a PR until I pass your test."
- **Demand proof**: "Prove to me this works" — diff behaviour between main and feature branch.
- **Force elegance**: "Knowing everything you know now, scrap this and implement the elegant solution."
- **Section review**: "Do a full review of the /[section-name] section" triggers the fix-function skill.
- **Autonomous mode**: Point at logs, Slack threads, or failing CI and just say "fix."

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev      # Start development server
npm run build    # Production build
npm run lint     # ESLint (zero warnings enforced)
npm test         # Run Vitest tests
npx supabase db push   # Apply pending migrations
```

**Node version:** Use Node 20 LTS (as pinned in `.nvmrc`). Run `nvm use` before development. The `engines` field in `package.json` enforces `>=20 <23`.

## Architecture

**Additional integrations**: Twilio (SMS), Microsoft Graph (email), Stripe, PayPal.

**Route groups**:
- `(authenticated)/` — all staff-facing pages, auth enforced at layout level
- `(staff-portal)/portal/` — employee-only views (shifts, pay)
- `(timeclock)/timeclock/` — public kiosk access (no auth)
- `(employee-onboarding)/` — onboarding flows
- `api/cron/` — Vercel cron endpoints (require `Authorization: Bearer CRON_SECRET`)
- `api/webhooks/` — Twilio, Stripe, PayPal webhooks

**Auth**: Supabase Auth with JWT + HTTP-only cookies. `src/middleware.ts` is currently **disabled** (renamed `.disabled` after a Vercel incident); auth is enforced in `(authenticated)/layout.tsx` via `supabase.auth.getUser()`. Public path prefixes: `/timeclock`, `/parking/guest`, `/table-booking`, `/g/`, `/m/`, `/r/`.

## Supabase Clients

- **`src/lib/supabase/server.ts`** — cookie-based auth, use in server actions and API routes
- **`src/lib/supabase/admin.ts`** — service role key, bypasses RLS; use for system/cron operations
- ESLint rule prevents importing the admin singleton in client components

## Permissions (RBAC)

```typescript
await checkUserPermission('module', 'action', userId)
```

Modules: `calendar`, `customers`, `employees`, `events`, `invoices`, `messages`, `parking`, `private-bookings`, `receipts`, `rota`, `leave`, `timeclock`, `payroll`, `settings`, `roles`, etc.
Actions: `view`, `create`, `edit`, `delete`, `publish`, `request`, `clock`, `manage`.
Roles: `super_admin`, `manager`, `staff`. Defined in `src/types/rbac.ts`.

## Key Libraries & Utilities

- **`src/lib/dateUtils.ts`** — `getTodayIsoDate()`, `toLocalIsoDate()`, `formatDateInLondon()` etc. London timezone hardcoded.
- **`src/lib/email/emailService.ts`** — `sendEmail(to, subject, html, cc?, attachments?)` via Microsoft Graph
- **`src/lib/sms/`** — Twilio wrapper with safety guards (hourly/daily rate limits, idempotency)
- **`src/services/`** — business logic services (CustomerService, EmployeeService, PermissionService, etc.)

## UI Components

Migrating from legacy `PageWrapper`/`Page` pattern to `PageLayout` + `HeaderNav` from `src/components/ui-v2/`. New pages must use the `ui-v2` pattern. Navigation defined in `src/components/ui-v2/navigation/AppNavigation.tsx`.

## Data Conventions

- Server actions body size limit: 20 MB (for file uploads)
- Dashboard data cached via `loadDashboardSnapshot()` in `src/app/(authenticated)/dashboard/`
- Date/holiday pre-computation: `buildConfirmedUKDates()` in calendar-notes actions

## Scheduled Jobs (vercel.json crons)

| Route | Schedule |
|---|---|
| `/api/cron/parking-notifications` | 0 5 * * * |
| `/api/cron/rota-auto-close` | 0 5 * * * |
| `/api/cron/rota-manager-alert` | 0 18 * * 0 |
| `/api/cron/rota-staff-email` | 0 21 * * 0 |
| `/api/cron/private-bookings-weekly-summary` | 0 * * * * |
